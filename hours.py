                          # Hours 


# Goal: Write a program that tells what time it will be in a user inputted amount of hours. 

"""
Example Output: 
    $ python hours.py
    What hour is it? 9
    How many hours will pass? 6
    In 6 hours it will be 3 o'clock

Background: 
    To better understand how the modulus (%) operator works, lets play around 
    with the concept of time! What happens when it’s 9 pm and 4 hours pass by? 
    Surely it’s not 13 pm, right? Hmm… How can modulus help us represent time in this way?

Your Mission: 
    Write a program called hours.py that asks for the current hour, a number of hours to 
    pass, and then prints the time after. Only the numbers 1-12 should be used 
    for hours (HINT: % 12 will limit to 0-11, but 0 is equivalent to what hour?. Hmm…)
