# Goal: Create a program that converts a temperature in Celsius into Fahrenheit. 

"""
Background: 
    It’s amazing that the US is one a few countries that still uses Fahrenheit! 
    Let’s make a program that helps us calculate a relate temperature in Fahrenheit 
    when given Celsius so that we may understand the temperature no matter where we go!


Your Mission: 
    We’re going to create a program called fahrenheit.py that will help us 
    with these temperature conversions. For this problem, we’re going to focus 
    on converting in just one direction: from Celsius to Fahrenheit. 
    As it happens, the formula for this conversion isn’t terribly complex. 
    (Phew!) One simply takes the current temperature in degrees Celsius (°C), 
    multiplies it by 9, divides by 5, and then adds 32. 
    The result is the equivalent temperature in degrees Fahrenheit (°F). 
    Not bad, right? For the more visually inclined, this translates to this formula:
        F = ((C * 9) / 5) + 32 

    Let’s do a quick test to make sure things work as expected. Worldwide, the 
    commonly accepted value for normal human body temperature is 37°C. 
    If we plug “37” into that formula where °C goes and do the math 
    (37 multiplied by 9 is 333, 333 divided by 5 is 66.6, 66.6 + 32 is 98.6) 
    we get 98.6°F which is what folks in the United States know as normal 
    human body temperature. So that checks out. Similarly if we plug in 0°C 
    (the freezing point of water) into that formula does it convert to 32°F, 
    and 100°C (the boiling point of water) is apparently equivalent to 212°F. 
    Seems like things are going well.

    We’re ready to create a program! We want our program to behave like the below:

        $ python fahrenheit.py
        C: 100
        F: 212.0

""" 


# Code goes below 

# Get user input for degrees (in Celsius) and convert to Fahrenheit 
c = int(input("C: "))
f = ((c * 9) / 5) + 32

print(f"F: {f}")
