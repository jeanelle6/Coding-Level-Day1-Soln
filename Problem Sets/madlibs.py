# Goal: Print some faces and shapes! 


"""
Background: 
    If youâ€™ve never heard of Mad Libs, 
    they are basically stories with a fill in the blank structure. 
    The reader is to provide some nouns, adjectives, and adverbs in order to 
    fill the blanks often to a hilarious effect! For more info on how 
    Mad Libs work, go to this link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs


Your Mission: 
    Create a python program called madlibs.py that asks the user for various 
    strings and creates an Mad Lib story like the output structure below dictates.


Output Structure: 
    Enter a name: [name]
    Enter an adjective: [adjective 1]
    Enter another adjective: [adjective 2]
    Enter an adverb: [adverb]
    Enter a food: [food 1]
    Enter another food: [food 2]
    Enter a noun: [noun]
    Enter a place: [place]
    Enter a verb: [verb]
    [name] was planning a dream vacation to [place].
    [name] was especially looking forward to trying the local
    cuisine, including [adjective 1] [food 1] and [adjective 2] [food 2].

    [name] will have to practice the language [adverb] to
    make it easier to [verb] with people.

    [name] has a long list of sights to see, including the
    [noun] museum and the [adjective 1] river.


Example Run (in terminal): 
    ~/workspace/ $ python adlibs.py
